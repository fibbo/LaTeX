\section{Permission denied on EOS}

If running an operation that want's to create something on EOS and I get as an error that I don't have permission for it:

\begin{itemize}
\item If I'm working with a proxy, I'm mapped to user \texttt{lhcb001}
\item If I'm working without proxy and am working with kerberos and this should be mapped to \texttt{pgloor}
\item check with \texttt{eos ls -la /path/to/folder} the permission in that structure
\item 
\end{itemize}
